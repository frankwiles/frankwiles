Hi Friend, you can learn more about me on my [personal homepage](https://frankwiles.com/about/) or [subscribe to my newsletter](https://buttondown.com/frankwiles). 

Happy to connect with you on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frankwiles/), [Mastodon](https://frankwiles.social/@frank), or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/fwiles.bsky.social).  I *mostly* post about tech things, but you also will be subjected to the 
occasional picture of my cooking.  

I'm the founder of [REVSYS](https:/www.revsys.com/) we help companies solve problems usually 
with some mixture of Python, Django, Javascript, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes and magic. Er... I mean AI.   

We're known for using our experience to deliver practical solutions that speed up your people, processes, and 
projects.
